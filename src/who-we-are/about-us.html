	    <p>
	      On average, most of us will spend over a third of our waking lives at work. That’s why at BOxD, we have this radical idea that work should -- at the very least -- enrich people’s lives and improve their wellbeing. BOxD was born so that we could reimagine what the workplace can look, feel and sound like at its best.
	    </p>

	    <p class="font-weight-bold">
              We know that when people work at the intersection of their passion and strengths for a meaningful purpose, this is the sweet spot for everyone. That’s why we care about working with people and companies that are committed to making a positive impact on the communities they serve and operate in.

            <h1><b>Our Guiding Principles:</b></h1>

            <p>
              <strong>1. We do what's right for our clients, not what's easy.</strong><br />
              We anchor our solutions on proven methods, but we flex to your business needs. We are here to help you create sustainable solutions--and we know that handholding is not the same as empowerment. If your project is not a fit for our skills or services, we will refer you to another trusted partner.
            </p>

            <p>
            <strong>2. We leave things better than we found them.</strong><br />

            Every BOxD team member is driven by a deep desire for positive change. Our goal in every interaction--even a brief phone call--is to expand our collective thinking, make progress on plans, and build client readiness.
            </p>

            <p>
            <strong>3. We take self-improvement seriously.</strong><br />
            We prioritize growth and continuous learning. Our learning never stops--and we don't want it to. We dedicate time for reflection after every project or milestone. We see every client engagement as an opportunity for deep, mutual learning.

	  <p>
	  BOxD was born from the hearts and minds of two passionate changemakers, Nenuca Syquia and Lydia Petrovic.
	  </p>

	  <p>
          Nenuca was one of the first people to formally work in the organization design space at Cisco, where she used her talent for connecting the dots to redesign systems for effectiveness. What she loved most about her work was seeing how individuals, teams and leaders could thrive once their goals, strengths, and operating environment were aligned. She dreamed of helping smaller companies use design thinking and org design to achieve greatness, alongside industry giants like Cisco.
	  </p>

	  <p>
          Like many OD practitioners, Lydia’s background includes a tapestry of roles across industries: teacher, translator, sales director, and operations lead. Her experience working with so many different folks at every level gave her firsthand insight into the way people respond to large scale change. She entered the field of OD with a dream of making work feel better for people, by using her gift of tapping into individual strengths and motivations.
	  </p>

	  <p>
          Nenuca met Lydia at the University of San Francisco, where they joined the same cohort for an Organizational Development masters program. Together they built Better Organizations by Design, a new kind of consulting firm that would offer sophisticated organization design tools that reside on a bedrock of shared principles: equity, sustainability, and human connection.
