"Website isn't designed to be edited in a dashboard"
Developer tools are needed to edit it. I used a simple approach for a web developer to edit the code.

Blog - use a current platform and just link to the website
What pages do you foresee updating regularly? And how many times a month?
Pending tasks like adding Google Analytics - I need access to the code snippet.
Postmark - 100 emails a month
Netflify - new hosting service, transfer of account
How much were you spending before on hosting?


once a month new people

new client - add someone new
